Hi!
I am Kartik, software developer at Micrsoft and a tech enthusiast. Hit me up on my social to chat about Distributed Systems, Databases, Machine learning and AI. 
Here are few things about me.

*   I am currently working with the Azure Cosmos DB team, ensuring that our flagship database offering scales without hiccups providing customers a one of a kind Database As A Service experience. I have also worked on full stack projects using technologies like JS, Angular, React and C#. I am also the maintainer of Page Tour SDK hosted on the Microsoft GitHub page. Check it out here(https://github.com/microsoft/PageTour-SDK).

*   I have a pretty strong academic record and have also received tuition scholarship during my undergraduate studies.

*   Opinion: Tech conferences should have been bags for sitting. Check out my favorite talk from the JS conference here(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ).

In my free time I like to watch F1, and play the F1 game.
